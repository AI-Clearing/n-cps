We present n-CPS â€“ a generalisation of the recent state-of-the-art [cross pseudo supervision (CPS)]() approach for the task of semi-supervised semantic segmentation. In n-CPS, there are n simultaneously trained subnetworks that learn from each other through one-hot encoding perturbation and consistency regularisation. We also show that ensembling techniques applied to subnetworks outputs can significantly improve the performance. To the best of our knowledge, n-CPS paired with Cut-Mix outperforms CPS and sets the new state-of-the-art for Pascal VOC 2012 with (1/16, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 supervised regimes) and Cityscapes (1/16 supervised).

The code in this repository is based mostly on the original [CPS repository](https://github.com/charlesCXK/TorchSemiSeg) and [NVidia Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex).
